## How i start?

To start, you just have to wait for a magical trader and have some logs, sticks, buckets and glass blocks to trade a mage wand and a collector pylon.

The mage wand can help you for the placement of the collector pylon. The collector pylon can get essence depending on the biomes where it is placed.
